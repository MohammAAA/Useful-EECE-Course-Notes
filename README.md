# My-Useful-EECE-Course-Notes
This repo contains some useful course notes and illustrations throughout my 4-year studies in electronics and electrical communications engineering department in Cairo university.

The courses provided here are somehow related to the embedded systems field, software engineering and computer hardware, that's why I consider these are the most useful technical courses I have taken in college. And that's why I've decided to take part in helping our class getting the most out of these courses by providing some course notes and simple illustrations.

The repo contains the following courses:
* Computer Architecture
* Data Structure
* Operating Systems
